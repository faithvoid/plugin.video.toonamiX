# Features:
- All Toonami Aftermath channels available!
- View the schedule of your favourite channel via the context menu!

## How To Use:
- Download & extract the latest release file (if you'd like to test out the new schedule functions, the entire repository instead!)
- If outside of EST, modify your timezone in "default.py"
- Copy the "ToonamiX" folder to Q:/plugins/video

## Issues:
- 720p video resolution (not console resolution!) WILL crash your Xbox, so make sure videos are rendering at 480p in your settings! This isn't an add-on issue, this is a hardware issue.
- Sometimes the stream may not load. Try it again, and if it doesn't work, you may have to come back later. This doesn't seem to be an issue with the addon, as whenever this happens I also can't connect to TA channels via .m3u8 on any other system, but the homepage stream still works.
- You tell me.

## TODO:
- Integrate chat as notifications(?)
- Improve timezone detection / modification
- Replace show name values with their "fullname" equivalents where available (as right now shows like Dragon Ball Z simply appear as 'DBZ')
- Optimize, optimize, optimize.

## Credits:
- Toon - for Toonami Aftermath + the TATV plugin!
